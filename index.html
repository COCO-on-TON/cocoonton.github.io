  <h1>TOCO Crowd raise</h1>

  <p>
    Contract Renounced <br>
    <b>EQBsHbF5PjjhTTRRcfzZ2Q56k_XkbBG8HPDWiGjDogJ8rC6N</b>
  </p>
  <p>Supply: 420 billion, 69 Million</p>

  <p>WARNING: DO NOT BUY during initial token distribution phase if market cap is over 100k</p>
  <p>
    Plan is to deploy 50% of the supply into the pool at the onset of the pools existence in a deferred manner:
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of an immediate deploy of all tokens, tokens will be deployed on a schedule to avoid token snipers getting
    an
    unfair advantage over actual users. The plan favors small buyers over whales and allows more people a fair shot at
    getting in at a good price.
  </p>
  <p>
    A small percent of the supply, 3,274,521,868 TOCO (0.78%) will be sent to the pool. $200 USD worth of TON will be supplied and the LP tokens burned immediately. This will cause the initial market cap to be $25,000 Pool will settle for an undetermined period based on this
    example:
  </p>
  <p>
    users make purchases, a similar amount is sold into the pool and then liquidity is added to the pool. During this
    process, the price will be supressed in the bounds of 25k to 100k market cap.
  </p>
  <p>
    general example, similar but not in terms of specific pecents, which will be determined after dev observes "how it
    goes":
  <ul>
    <li>user buys 11 TON worth of TOCO from the pool</li>
    <li>10 ton worth of initial supply is sold into pool</li>
    <li>pool is supplied with 7.5 ton of liquidity and 7.5 ton worth of TOCO</li>
    <li>2.5 TON in pure ton is set aside for operation expenses</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This plan will go on for a period of time until half of the supply is distributed. There is no bot so all the seeding transactions will be manually operated so expect some time gaps in when seeding occurs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remaining supply will be distributed as follows, and a third party will hold tokens on the escrow recipients behalf
    according to their plan:
  </p>
  <p>
    Dev Salary:
    10% supply<br>
    Initial deferrence: 30 days<br>
    Payments to last for 20 months. Escrow salary is 5% of the dev distribution monthly. Once escrow is cleared, dev
    is free to do what he wants with the earned tokens.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once supply is distributed, known top holders with "non-dumpy" wallets will receive LP tokens as rewards which are going to also be escrowed for
    a period of time in order to preserve the pools' liquidity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remaining 40% will be preserved and then distributed via an undisclosed product similar to where people stake their tokens and earn
    rewards from the initial pool. In order to prevent "yielder bleed" from occurring, this may include token burns to
    reduce supply.
  </p>
